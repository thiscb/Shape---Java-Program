Shape Calculator
This program is a menu-driven application that calculates the area and volume of various shapes. The shapes that are currently supported include Circle, Rectangle, Square, Sphere, Cylinder, and Pyramid.

Installation
To use this program, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the official website.

Once Java is installed, you can download the source code for this project from the GitHub repository. You can either clone the repository using Git, or download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.

Copy code
java Main
This will start the program and display the main menu. From there, you can select a shape and enter the necessary measurements to calculate its area or volume.

Classes
The program is divided into several classes, each of which represents a different shape:

Circle: represents a circle
Rectangle: represents a rectangle
Square: represents a square
Sphere: represents a sphere
Cylinder: represents a cylinder
Pyramid: represents a pyramid
Each of these classes extends the abstract Shape class, which provides a common interface for calculating the area and perimeter of a shape. The Volume interface is implemented by the Sphere, Cylinder, and Pyramid classes, which adds a method for calculating the volume of the shape.
